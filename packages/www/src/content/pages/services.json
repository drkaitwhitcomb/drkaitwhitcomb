First, we’ll do a free phone consultation to make sure I’m a good fit for you. Then we’ll do a few sessions together, so I can better understand your concerns, history, and goals. After that, we’ll develop a flexible treatment plan using research-supported treatments. This document will help you understand what to expect from our time together, so you can see the steps we’ll take to help you reach your goals.",
